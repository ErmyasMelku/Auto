# A/B Testing Simulation for Product Features
Overview
- This project simulates an A/B test to evaluate the effectiveness of a new product feature. The goal is to analyze whether there is a statistically significant difference in user conversion between the control group (A) and the test group (B).

Project Components:

Data Generation: Synthetic user interaction data is generated to simulate an A/B test scenario.
Statistical Analysis: A two-sample t-test is performed to assess the significance of the difference between the groups.
Visualization: The results of the test are visualized for easy interpretation.
Technologies Used:

- Python: For data generation, analysis, and visualization.
- Pandas: To handle the data.
- Scipy: To perform statistical tests.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
